# To-Do App

[Live Demo](https://todo-app-by-at.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview

The **To-Do App** is a simple yet efficient task management tool built using React.js. It allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks effectively. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete them, and filter the list based on their status.

## Key Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## Development Process

1. **Planning**: 
   - Designed a simple user interface for task management.
   - Chose React.js for its component-based architecture and dynamic rendering.

2. **Implementation**: 
   - Built individual components like `TaskList`, `TaskInput`, and `TaskFilters`.
   - Used `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management.
   - Added filtering functionalities for tasks based on their completion status.

3. **Testing**:
   - Manually tested across different browsers and devices to ensure responsiveness.
   - Fixed any bugs encountered during task addition, deletion, and filtering.

4. **Deployment**: 
   - Hosted on Netlify for easy deployment and continuous integration.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **State Management**: Managing the state of tasks across different components was a challenge. Implemented local state using `useState` to simplify the process.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensured a mobile-first design to cater to users across devices.

## Learnings

- Enhanced skills in React.js, specifically in state management and component lifecycle.
- Gained experience in deploying React apps using Netlify.

## Future Scope

- Add user authentication to allow personalized to-do lists.
- Implement a database to store tasks for persistent data.
- Add due dates and reminders for tasks.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a functional and responsive to-do list application using React.js. It highlights effective task management, allowing users to track their productivity.
